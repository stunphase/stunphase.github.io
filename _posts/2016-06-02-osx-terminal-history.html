<h1>bash history in OS/X Terminal</h1>
<p>I've noticed a few annoying things about the way Terminal in OS/X handles history.</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>It truncates history back to 500 entries if you open multiple sessions</li>
    <li>It seems to ignore some commands, which never quite make it into history.</li>
    <li>It appears not to pay attention to variables like HISTSIZE</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Today I opened the file at /private/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal and discovered that this is all because of the way sessions are handled.</p>
<P>I added the following to my ~/.bash_profile to change the way history and sessions are handled in Terminal.
  {%highlight sh%}
export HISTSIZE=100000
export HISTFILESIZE=200000

# see /private/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal
export SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY=0 # share a single history between term sessions
`touch ~/.bash_sessions_disable` 
{%endhighlight%}
</p>
<p>I don't mind disabling sessions, since I always close out all my Terminal windows when I'm done with them. But, I'm sure you can figure out your own best configuration if you read through the contents of /private/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal</p>
