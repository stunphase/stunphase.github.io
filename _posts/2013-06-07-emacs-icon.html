<p>Yesterday Brent was showing off a customized icon he had downloaded for Sublime Text. After browsing the net for a bit, I concluded there weren't any really cool Emacs icons out there.</p>
<p>Brent took on the challenge, and this is the result:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Emacs.png" /></p>
<h3>Thanks Brent. This is a rad icon.</h3>
<p>You should be able to convert the above png image to whatever format you might need, or you can <a href="/images/Emacs.icns"> download the icns file for OS/X. </a></p>
<p>I'm using OS/X with <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/"> this dmg Emacs installation </a> on my computer. To install the icon, replace the file Emacs.icns using a command like this: {% highlight bash %} sudo mv ~/Downloads/Emacs.icns /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/ {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>If you're running emacs in Linux, Windows, or an OS of your own devising, I'm sure you can figure out a similar way to replace your icon.</p>
<h2>About the icon</h2>
<p>To generate the screenshot in the background, I launched emacs without loading the init file, then set the background color to black and the foreground color to white. The code snippet is from auto-complete.el. Take a look at the mode-line.</p>
