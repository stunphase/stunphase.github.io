<h1>ActiveRecord API changes in Rails 4</h1>
<p>I found myself scratching my head today over what turned out to be an API change in rails 4. When I called destroy on a record, its dependent records remained. Check out the code below:</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby%}
# in rails 3.x
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :product_options, :dependent => :destroy
end

# in rails 4.x
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :product_options, nil, :dependent => :destroy
end{%endhighlight%}
</p>

<p>The new second argument, passed as nil in the example above, is a scope for the relationship, somewhat similar to the old :conditions option. It accepts the kinds of things you typically pass to the #where method. This is powerful new functionality, but it took me a minute to figure out why the options weren't being accepted.</p>

<p>Simple, but consider this a helpful PSA.</p>
