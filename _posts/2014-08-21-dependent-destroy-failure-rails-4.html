<h1>ActiveRecord API changes in Rails 4</h1>
<p>I found myself scratching my head today over what turned out to be an API change in rails 4. When I called destroy on a record, its dependent records remained. Check out the code below:</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby%}
# in rails 3.x
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :product_options, :dependent => :destroy
end

# in rails 4.x
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :product_options, nil, :dependent => :destroy
end{%endhighlight%}
</p>

<p>The new second argument, passed as nil in the example above, is a scope for the relationship. </p>

<h2>Wait a second, how were all my associations working, then?</h2>
<p>Well, it turns out that active record, in the absence of a valid scope, assumes the scope was intended to be the options hash</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby%}
module ActiveRecord::Associations::Builder
  class Association

    # ...

    def initialize(model, name, scope, options)

      # ...

      if scope.is_a?(Hash)
        @scope   = nil
        @options = scope
      else
        @scope   = scope
        @options = options
      end
end{%endhighlight%}
</p>

<p>And here's where the block gets processed:</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby%}
      if @scope && @scope.arity == 0
        prev_scope = @scope
        @scope = proc { instance_exec(&prev_scope) }
      end
end{%endhighlight%}
</p>

<h2>So then why should I care?</h2>
<p>I was getting a bit confused about argument order. Personally, I find it useful to just insert a nil there as a placeholder for the time I want to insert a scope. This prevents me from just shoving it in at the end of the options hash.</p>
